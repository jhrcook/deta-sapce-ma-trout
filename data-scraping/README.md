# Scrape trout stocking data from the MA DCR website

Run as a cron job action on Deta.

To-Do:

- [x] refactor into binary and library
- [x] add a server component to receive Deta action requests
- [ ] add proper logging instead of just print statements (with 'tracing'?)

Troubles pushing to Deta:

- compilation times-out

To try:

- build on a linux machine in a GitHub Action and push from there
